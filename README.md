# Designing an Enterprise Agentic AI Scheduler in n8n

#### This repository presents  step-by-step process of how an Agentic AI Scheduler for enterprise application was desined in n8n. 

#### The repository is designed for AI Architects that prefers to follow the low-code alternative for Agentic AI integration in the enterprise offered by n8b. 

#### For a full discourse on how the Agent can be deployed in the enterprise with scalability on mind, interested readers can visit: https://github.com/manuelbomi/Enterprise-Agentic-AI---Scalable-Meeting-Orchestration-with-n8n

#### Redears can also deploy the Agent by cloning the .json file in the repo. A full discourse on how the solution architect can accomplish that is also avaialble here: https://github.com/manuelbomi/Enterprise-Agentic-AI---Scalable-Meeting-Orchestration-with-n8n

#### This is the Agentic AI Scheduler that was designed by following the procedures outlined in this discourse:

--- 

###  ðŸ’¬ The Agent can converse with the user as shown below:

---
```ruby

Hereâ€™s how a typical interaction looks once the workflow is deployed:

User:
"Can you schedule a 30-minute meeting with John tomorrow afternoon?"

AI Agent:
"Sure! Let me check your calendar for availability tomorrow afternoon..."

(Agent uses Google Calendar to fetch free slots)

AI Agent:
"You are free at 2:00 PM, 3:30 PM, and 4:15 PM. Which works best for you?"

User:
"Letâ€™s go with 3:30 PM."

AI Agent:
"Perfect. Scheduling the meeting with John at 3:30 PM tomorrow. Do you want me to add a description?"

User:
"Yes â€” add 'Project Roadmap Discussion'."

AI Agent:
"Done! Iâ€™ve scheduled 'Project Roadmap Discussion' with John tomorrow at 3:30 PM, and added it to your Google Calendar."


```

#### Below are figures showing how the Agent converse with users and execute its job via the n8n user interface:
